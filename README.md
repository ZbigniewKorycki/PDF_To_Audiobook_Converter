<h1>PDF To Audiobook Converter</h1>

This Python script utilizes the PyPDF2 and gTTS libraries to convert a PDF document into an audiobook. It extracts text from a PDF file and generates an MP3 audio file that can be listened to on various devices.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 91.
